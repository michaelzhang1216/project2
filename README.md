# Project 2: Air Pollution and Sickle Cell Disease

## Overview
This project examines trends in ambient air pollutants (CO, PM2.5, O3) at the RDU airport monitor during 2018–2020 and their potential relation to sickle cell disease outcomes.

## Repository Contents
- `AQ_2018.csv`, `AQ_2019.csv`, `AQ_2020.csv`: Raw daily pollutant measurements
- `project2.Rmd`: R Markdown report with data processing, analysis, plots, and interpretation
- `README.md`: This file

## Instructions
1. Open `project2.Rmd` in RStudio.
2. Ensure CSV files are in the same folder as the `.Rmd` file.
3. Knit the document to Word to generate the final report.
4. The plots include:
   - Monthly CO and O3 concentrations (averaged 2018–2020)
   - Monthly PM2.5 by year
